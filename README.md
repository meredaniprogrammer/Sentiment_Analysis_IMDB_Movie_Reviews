# Sentiment_Analysis_IMDB_Movie_Reviews
Msc Dissertation Project
This study explores sentiment analysis by focusing on understanding sentiments within IMDB movie reviews. In today's world, where there is abundant user-generated content and online opinions, users and those creating it must understand sentiment analysis correctly in movie reviews. This research evaluates various machine learning algorithms to understand the feelings in these movie reviews. The field of sentiment analysis is filled with possibilities and challenges. Machine learning algorithms have demonstrated considerable potential in accurately classifying sentiments. However, the path to understanding sentiment has pitfalls, such as sarcasm, interpretability, and overfitting. These challenges are not unique to this research but are shared across various studies.
The methodology proposed in this dissertation takes a comprehensive approach to tackle the complexities of sentiment analysis. It starts with carefully selecting an IMDB dataset rich in user reviews, which is crucial for unbiased model evaluation. The journey continues with a thorough data analysis designed to reveal the hidden patterns within the movie reviews. The raw textual data is transformed into a structured format using advanced preprocessing techniques, making it easier for machine learning models to analyse.
A variety of models were evaluated in this study, including Naive Bayes Multinomial (NBM), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Logistic Regression (LR), and Decision Tree (DT). The findings show that the NBM model emerges as a frontrunner with superior accuracy.
